# Overview #

## Background Context ##
Rotating a 2D matrix 90 degrees clockwise is a common interview challenge.  It's relatively simple to implement in Python and while it seems like an abstract concept, its application is useful in various areas of software development which include:
- Image Rotation: Rotating an image by 90 degrees is a common operation in image editing, photo manipulation, or preprocessing for computer vision.
- Game Development: Used to rotate sprites, textures, or game maps in 2D games.
- Canvas Manipulation: In GUI applications, it is often necessary to rotate elements for alignment or styling.
- Chart Orientation: Rotating heatmaps, tables, or grid-based plots for better visualization.
- Text Alignment: Reorienting labels or titles in a graphical representation.
- Tetris: Rotating blocks is a fundamental mechanic in games like Tetris, where shapes are rotated 90 degrees to fit into spaces.
- And many other instances where a grid roatation is a needed.

So now knowing that it's useful and applicable, sit back, relax and reminisce on how you can apply this technique in the future. Cheers and Happy Coding!
