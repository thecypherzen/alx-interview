## The Coin Change Problem ##
The coin change problem is a classic problem from the domain of dynamic programming and greedy algorithms. The objective is to find the minimum number of coins required to make up a given total amount, given a list of coin denominations. 

This project challenges the  application one's understanding of algorithms to devise a solution that is not only correct but also efficient.

Here are the key concepts and resources necessary to complete this project successfully.

### Concepts Needed: ###
#### Greedy Algorithms: ####
- Understanding how greedy algorithms work and why they are suitable for the coin change problem.
- Recognizing the limitations of greedy algorithms and scenarios where they might not provide the optimal solution.

#### Dynamic Programming: ####
- Basic principles of dynamic programming as a method to solve optimization problems.
- The concept of overlapping subproblems and optimal substructure in the context of the coin change problem.

#### Algorithmic Complexity: ####
- Analyzing the time and space complexity of algorithms.
- Striving for solutions with lower complexity to meet runtime constraints.

#### Problem-Solving Strategies: ####
- Breaking down the problem into smaller, manageable sub-problems.
- Iterative vs recursive approaches to dynamic programming.

#### Python Programming: ####
- Manipulating lists and using list comprehensions.
- Implementing functions with efficient looping and conditional statements.
